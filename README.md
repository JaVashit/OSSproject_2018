## Getting Started
To use this project, you have to set up Opencv library(3.4.1) and MFC environment.


### Usage
First, you have to select converting options which have Gray-scale or color. 
Second, you should choose image which you want to convert.
Thrid, you should click "ok" button if you check converted image and then, the image will save your storage.


## Notice
We deal with using MFC first time, so you can face some of lackness in this project.
So, Welcome to opinion to be better :laughing: :laughing:
